## Reproduce TaxAss validation using full-length 16S assignments

This readme walks you through the data processing to reproduce "simulated 
tag data" from full-length 16S sequences. This was used to validate TaxAss.

The process:  

* Start with full length 16S sequences from Marathonas reservoir in Greece.   
    * These do not already exist in the FreshTrain database.  
* Align the full length sequences to the FreshTrain manually using Arb.   
    * The result of this is zipped in this folder. Likely chimeras were removed.  
* Trim the full-length Marathonas sequences to a primer region of choice.   
    * That's where this Readme picks up.  
* Assign taxonomy to the short primer regions using TaxAss.  
    * When I say "tax!", you say "ass!"  
* Compare the TaxAss assignment results to the "true" classifications known 
from the full length alignments.
