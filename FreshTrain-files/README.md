The FreshTrain
===

The zipped files in this folder contain the McMahon Lab's custom taxonomy database for lake epilimia, fondly referred to as *The FreshTrain* (for Freshwater Training Set). There are 3 files inside each zipped folder:  

1. The `.taxonomy` file is a table with sequence IDs followed by taxonomic names.   
2. The `.fasta` file lists the nucleotide sequence for each sequence ID.  
3. The readme file describes the changes in the current version of the database.  

There are several different versions of the FreshTrain available:
