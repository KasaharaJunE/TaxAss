RRR 7-20-16

These scripts generate the final versions of figures and tables for the paper. 
Many of the figures and tables are already generated in the workflow, but this is
the version of the script where I tweak colors, dimensions, resolution, etc.
For tables, a csv with the data is generated here but I formatted it using excel.

Also included are figures generated for my ISME16 poster.
