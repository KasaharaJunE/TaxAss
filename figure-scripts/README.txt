README for figure-scripts

These scripts generate the final versions of figures and tables for the paper. 
Many of the figures and tables are already generated in the workflow, but this is
the version of the script where I tweak colors, dimensions, resolution, etc.
For tables, a csv with the data is generated here and msphere reformatted it.  

Also included are figures generated for my ISME16 poster, figures that didn't make 
the final cut, and a script for finding all the stats listed in the text.  

The folder structure for reproducing the manuscript's data is `TaxAss-BatchFiles.zip`. 
This folder pairs with the directions in `README-TaxAss-BatchFiles.html`.

The Marathonas validation batch files and directions are inside the `arb-scripts` folder. 
The directions are in the file `arb-scripts/Marathonas_test/README_marathonas_validation.html` 
and all necessary files are also in that folder.
